# A short history of Martin

Hi, my name is Martin. I was born in Sofia, Bulgaria on January 31, 1999. I grew up in a loving family and often spent my summers with my grandma and cousins. I attended a private high school called *the American College of Sofia*. Ever since I was a kid, I always loved cars. I raced go-karts at the local track in my city and even competed in some amateur leagues. When I turned 14, I started racing in the National Bulgarian Karting Championship and even won a race. Unfortunately, as I grew older, it got more and more expensive and I had to quit, but my love for cars, motorsport, and F1 remains.

In high school, I picked up photography. My dad always had a camera on him as I was growing up, so it was only a matter of time before I started as well. I quickly picked up some skills and even became the president of the photography club at ACS. Later, I continued with photography in uni, where I ran the club for 3 semesters and organised the first film photography workship, establishing a path for all students to gain access to the dark room, which used to be reserved only for arts students. I post some of my pictures in my blog [(Link)](https://twttg.tumblr.com/), although I have not posted in a while.

I hold a Bachelor's degree from New York University Abu Dhabi. Although telling my parents I will be attending university in the Middle East was a surprise, NYUAD has given me some of my fondest memories. It is the most international school in the world, it has an amazing travel culture, and it offered me a top-quality education for free. I have been able to visit countries like Sri Lanka, Lebanon, and China, as well as complete two semesters away at NYU Stern.

I am currently pursuing career in Investment Banking alngside a Master's degree at London Business School. I have previous internship experience in banks like Canaccord Genuity and Digital Capital Advisors, as well as consulting experience with KPMG. Last summer, I wroked for a small VC fund based out of the UAE called Anamcara Capital.

This has been a short summary of my life so far but I am sure there will be a lot more to write soon.
