# Homework 3, Challenge 1: Yield Curve Inversion

In this assignment, I created 3 beautiful visualizations of US Treasury securities in order to gain a better understanding of the yield curve and what its inversion might mean.

Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the "inverted yield curve" and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explination of what a [inverted yield curve is can be found here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA). If you'd rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from [NPR on yield curve indicators](https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11)

In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., [*Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis). One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and [use the attached parable on yield curve inversions](https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873).

In our case we will look at US data and use the [FRED database](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. To know more, an article that explains the [yield curve is and its inversion can be found here](https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/). 

First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01:

```{r download_historical_yield_curve, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

yield_curve <- read_csv(here::here("data", "yield_curve.csv"))

glimpse(yield_curve)
```

Our dataframe `yield_curve` has five columns (variables):

- `date`: already a date object
- `series_id`: the FRED database ticker symbol
- `value`: the actual yield on that date
- `maturity`: a short hand for the maturity of the bond
- `duration`: the duration, written out in all its glory!

### Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
yield_curve %>% 
  group_by(maturity) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = value,
             color = maturity))+
  # We use this code to order the graphs based on maturity; We also specify that we want 2 columns 
    facet_wrap(~ factor(duration, 
                        levels = c("3-Month Treasury Bill",
                                   "6-Month Treasury Bill",
                                   "1-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "2-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "3-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "5-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "7-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "10-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "20-Year Treasury Rate",
                                   "30-Year Treasury Rate")), 
               ncol = 2)+
    geom_line()+
    theme_bw()+
    theme(legend.position = "none")+
    labs(title="Yields on U.S. Tresury Rates since 1960", 
       y = "%",
       x = "",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal reserve Economic Database (FRED)"
       ) +
  NULL
```


### Monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

yield_curve %>%
  #We create 2 new variables that take the month and year from the date variable respectively
  mutate(month = month(date),
         year = year(date)) %>%
  # We filter for date only after 1999
  filter(year >= 1999) %>%
  # We use levels to order the x-axis based on maturity
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(maturity, 
                        level = c("3m", 
                                  "6m", 
                                  "1y", 
                                  "2y", 
                                  "3y",
                                  "5y",
                                  "7y",
                                  "10y", 
                                  "20y", 
                                  "30y")),
             y = value))+
    facet_wrap(~ year, 
               ncol = 4)+
  # We use as.factor to color each graph based on the years
    geom_line(aes(group = month,
                  color = as.factor(year)))+
    theme_bw()+
    theme(legend.position = "none")+
    labs(title="US Yield Curve", 
       y = "Yield (%)",
       x = "Maturity",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal reserve Economic Database (FRED)"
       ) +
  NULL
```


### 3-month and 10-year yields since 1999

```{r, fig.width= 15, fig.height= 10, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

yield_curve %>%
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>%
  filter(year >= 1999) %>%
  #We filter for bonds that only have a 3-month and 10-year maturity
  filter( maturity == "10y" | maturity == "3m") %>% 
  group_by(maturity) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = date,
             y = value,
             color = duration))+
    geom_line()+
    theme_bw()+
  #We use this code to swap the colors of the two lines to match the original graph
    scale_color_hue(direction = -1, h.start=90)+
    labs(title="Yields on 3-Month and 10-Year Tresury rates since 1999", 
         x = "",
         y = "%",
       caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal reserve Economic Database (FRED)",
       color = "") +
  NULL
```


According to [Wikipedia's list of recession in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States), since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. In fact, we can see that the yield curve seems to flatten at those times since in both cases, the 10-year and the 3-month yield curves cross each other, suggesting the spread is equal to 0. We can see this happening in three places: around 2001 (Dot Com Bubble), around 2008 (The MBS Financial Crisis), and most recently around 2020 (The COVID-19 Pandemic). This can be explained by the fact that in anticipation of a recession and lower interest rate , investors buy long-term bonds and sell short-term ones, which affects their price and in turn, their yield. The evidence in the graph would suggest that the inversion of the yield curve is a good predictor of recessions.
