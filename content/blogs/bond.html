<h1>Homework 3, Challenge 1: Yield Curve Inversion</h1>
<p>In this assignment, I created 3 beautiful visualizations of US Treasury securities in order to gain a better understanding of the yield curve and what its inversion might mean.</p>
<p>Every so often, we hear warnings from commentators on the “inverted yield curve” and its predictive power with respect to recessions. An explination of what a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-economy-yieldcurve-explainer/explainer-what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-idUSKBN1O50GA">inverted yield curve is can be found here</a>. If you’d rather listen to something, here is a great podcast from <a href="https://www.podbean.com/media/share/dir-4zgj9-6aefd11">NPR on yield curve indicators</a></p>
<p>In addition, many articles and commentators think that, e.g., <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-14/u-k-yield-curve-inverts-for-first-time-since-financial-crisis"><em>Yield curve inversion is viewed as a harbinger of recession</em></a>. One can always doubt whether inversions are truly a harbinger of recessions, and <a href="https://twitter.com/5_min_macro/status/1161627360946511873">use the attached parable on yield curve inversions</a>.</p>
<p>In our case we will look at US data and use the <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/">FRED database</a> to download historical yield curve rates, and plot the yield curves since 1999 to see when the yield curves flatten. To know more, an article that explains the <a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2018/10/the-data-behind-the-fear-of-yield-curve-inversions/">yield curve is and its inversion can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>First, we will load the yield curve data file that contains data on the yield curve since 1960-01-01:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>yield_curve &lt;- read_csv(here::here(&quot;data&quot;, &quot;yield_curve.csv&quot;))

## $ maturity  &lt;chr&gt; &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, &quot;3m&quot;, ~
## $ duration  &lt;chr&gt; &quot;3-Month Treasury Bill&quot;, &quot;3-Month Treasury Bill&quot;, &quot;3-Month T~</code></pre>
<p>Our dataframe <code>yield_curve</code> has five columns (variables):</p>
<ul>
<li><code>date</code>: already a date object</li>
<li><code>series_id</code>: the FRED database ticker symbol</li>
<li><code>value</code>: the actual yield on that date</li>
<li><code>maturity</code>: a short hand for the maturity of the bond</li>
<li><code>duration</code>: the duration, written out in all its glory!</li>
</ul>

<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States">Wikipedia’s list of recession in the United States</a>, since 1999 there have been two recession in the US: between Mar 2001–Nov 2001 and between Dec 2007–June 2009. In fact, we can see that the yield curve seems to flatten at those times since in both cases, the 10-year and the 3-month yield curves cross each other, suggesting the spread is equal to 0. We can see this happening in three places: around 2001 (Dot Com Bubble), around 2008 (The MBS Financial Crisis), and most recently around 2020 (The COVID-19 Pandemic). This can be explained by the fact that in anticipation of a recession and lower interest rate , investors buy long-term bonds and sell short-term ones, which affects their price and in turn, their yield. The evidence in the graph would suggest that the inversion of the yield curve is a good predictor of recessions.</p>
